# Employee-Tracker-System

## Description

This is an application to manage a company's employee database. Many times IT members can often be clueless in designing and maintaining databases about the company in which they work. With my application, that task cesases to exist, as it is very easy to use. As this was my first project using MySQL, I was a bit unfamiliar with manipulating data in tables at first, but I later figured it out.

## Installation

You will need to have Node.js installed on your computer to run the application. Then you will need to clone the repository onto your computer. Open up a terminal, navigate to the project, and from there run "npm i" in your terminal. Lastly, run "node server.js" and from there you will be met with many different options regarding the company's departments, employees, and roles. You can navigate the menus by using the arrow keys as well as pressing enter.
